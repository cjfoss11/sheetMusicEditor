# Sheet Music Editor

This program is designed for a user to create, edit, and play back sheet music. It was created in Java and Java Swing, initially for Georgia Tech's "UI Software" class. I made changes and expanded its capabilities after completion of the class.

#### To run: 
##### Option 1:
Compile all files and run "Main.java"

##### Option 2:
Open sheetMusicEditor.jar
